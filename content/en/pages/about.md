## About Me
I discovered my passion for embedded systems early on—long before smartphones and IoT became household terms. I went on to earn my BSc in Electrics and Electronics Engineering in the late 2010s, immersing myself in the marriage of hardware and software. Since then, I’ve built my career around writing efficient, reliable firmware and low‑level drivers for everything from FCC(Flight Control Computer) computers of supersonic advanced jet trainer to ADCS(Attitude Determination and Control System) computers of LEO satellites. Besides my work in the aerospace industry, I’ve also dabbled in IoT consumer electronics and automotive systems, where I’ve honed my skills in real‑time operating systems (RTOS), low‑level programming, and hardware design.

This blog is my laboratory notebook: a place to document design patterns, debugging techniques, and novel algorithms as I architect everything from custom bootloaders to cross‑platform middleware. If you’re here, you might have landed on one of my deep dives into:

- **Control Software Desing/Simulation/Testing** — From PID controllers to Kalman filters, and from simulation to hardware-in-the-loop testing
- **STM32 Drivers & Bootloaders** — From NOR‑flash transactionally safe filesystems to MIL‑STD‑1553 bus monitors  
- **LoRa & LoRaWAN** — Implementing MIC calculations, CAD modes, and relay MAC layers in FreeRTOS environments  
- **Embedded Linux & PetaLinux** — Crafting custom kernel modules, device trees, and AXI‑Lite interfaces on Zynq platforms
