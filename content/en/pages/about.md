# About Me

I’m an embedded systems engineer with hands-on experience across the full stack of embedded development — from bare-metal firmware and real-time operating systems to Linux-based application design. My work spans a wide range of domains, including aerospace, IoT, and satellite systems.

I’ve contributed to the development of safety-critical flight control software (DO-178C Level A), built embedded middleware such as NOR flash fail-safe file systems, and implemented communication stacks over UART, SPI, I2C, CAN, and RF protocols like LoRa and LoRaWAN. I’ve also worked on attitude determination and control systems (ADCS), including BLDC motor drivers for reaction wheel assemblies.

Whether it's writing MISRA C for deeply embedded microcontrollers, designing model-based applications in Scade or Simulink, or building Qt-based desktop tools for engineering teams, I bring a system-level view and strong software craftsmanship to every project.

I enjoy working on robust, modular systems that are both efficient and maintainable. I’m also passionate about simulation, testing, and designing architectures that make embedded systems more reliable in the field.
